# RemoteDiceRoller
I needed a way to be able to roll dice for our remote RPG campaign, without relying on 3rd party applications (that have way more features than I need).

So far, there's a temporary server until a proper multi-session SPA web server is available. There's a windows client and I'll add an android one later.
